What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up the folder as a git repository adding the .git folder but does not
create any initial commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds changes that are being made but have not been commited separate from
the commited area/permanent storage.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding only the files you want each commit to store you are able to control commit size

Diagrams help you visually see how each branch moves off and which commits are on which branch


What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic mergins vs. always doing merges manually?
